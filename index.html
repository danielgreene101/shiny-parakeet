                <h2>Rick and Morty is back with the darkest timeline yet!</h2>
                <p>Co-creators Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon, storyboard artist Erica Hayes, and voice of Mr. Goldenfold Brandon Johnson held a ‚Äúspontaneous‚Äù livestream event on June 29th on AdultSwim.com. They showed a trailer for Season 3 which showed a lot of violence, the characters riding roller coasters, the characters in a Mad Max: Fury Road parody, some Pickle Rick, and a bunch of Summer being cloned and embiggened.</p>
                <p>Then they revealed the real premiere date. Rick and Morty Season 3 will air Sunday, July 30th at 11:30 PM EST.</p>

                    <h3>Rick stated in the previously aired pilot that this will be the darkest season the show has ever had and by the look of the trailer, this will be the case.</h3>
                    <p>Even for the smartest man in the multiverse, luck has to eventually run out in one dimension or the other. In the finale of the second season of Rick and Morty, the maverRick of all mavericks, Rick Sanchez, finally found himself restrained and hauled off to prison, arrested on behalf of the Galactic Federation. It was a sad moment, but a moment no one could argue wasn't coming.</p>

Morty. Without a doubt, Morty will suffer the most. Not even a question. He always have and always will suffer the most. Morty could even die. We have seen copies of him die before and Rick shows little to no remourse. üëæ
